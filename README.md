This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## FlashCard Pro

Followed some tutorial on Udemy to get an introduction to Redux and also some Front End React Testing.


### My thoughts so far...

I'm not sure I like the onchange events in the StackForm.js component, but maybe that's how things are done nowadays???

Also, the Stack component didn't account for page refresh...so when styling the stack page an error would pop up.  I had to fix it with a modification to component state so it would use window.localStorage.
